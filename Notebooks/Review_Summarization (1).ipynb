Definately pricey.. Bought the new Oasis for my wife. She already had the first Oasis and was very pleased with it. What sets this one apart is the 7\\\" screen. Much easier to see (we are not \\\"20ish by a longshot) and the battery not being in the case. It feels lighter than the old model but they are very close in actuality. To pay this much money for a tablet without color is only going to be worthwhile if you are an avid reader. Reading on the Kindle eReader is simply much, much easier on the eyes than a regular tablet like an iPad or a Kindle Fire. Not sure what the battery life will be, but reportedly many weeks, and if the old Oasis is any measure that will be true. Build quality is excellent. Aluminum back and not plastic. The leather cover must be purchased separately but is worth it to protect the screen and it looks great. There have been complaints that it does not lock on well, but it appears to be as secure as the previous cover for the Oasis. This case does not carry a battery as the previous generation but the battery in the device is much larger than the previous model.
