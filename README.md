##  Features

- **Data evaluation**: cleaning and preprocessing text data to optimize model performance.  
- **Model training**:  
  - Using **DistilBERT-base-uncased** and **all-MiniLM-L6-v2** (SentenceTransformers) for embeddings and classification.  
  - Applying **K-Means** for product category clustering.  
  - Fine-tuning **GPT-4-** with prompt engineering for summarization.  
- **Evaluation metrics**: accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, elbow method, silhouette score.
